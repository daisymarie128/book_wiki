WIKIPEDIA API BOOK STYLE
========================

# Built with:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Original concept

- My original concept for this was to create an interactive book which evoked feelings/emotions on the user which reflected the current text on the page. This would be done by picking out words in the current text and adding sounds depending on if specific words are found OR by creating a soundscape which went with the page ( did not have time for this), I also thought to include animated images. I wanted to add a timeline at the top so that when the user finished the book/article they could look back and see a collage of images joined together to create the whole story at a quick glance and remember all the parts they had read.

### Things to improve.

- Given the short amount of time and that this is more of a prototype than final product, I used a javascript library to help me construct the page flip animation quickly, I also did not have enough time to complete this to my absolute satisfaction, though for the short time frame I am happy with whats on the screen. I still need to edit some images, find more relevant imagery, find/create soundscapes and test with text, re-design the timeline at the top add style so that the images overlap and are edited better so they overlap and feel more like a collage.

##### Creators note
	---- Even though I did lose some important Vitamin-D, it was fun exploring the possibilities for how you could better the experience of an ebook.
