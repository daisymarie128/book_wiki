WIKIPEDIA API BOOK STYLE
========================

# Built with:

- HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Original concept

- My original concept for this was to create an interactive book using the current text displayed to evoke feelings/emotions to the user. 
- To achieve this, I wanted to be able to use the words on the page and associate them with sounds to create a soundscape per page (did not have time for this).
- I also wanted to include animated images. I wanted to add a timeline at the top so that when the user finished the book/article they could look back and see a collage of images joined together to create the whole story at a quick glance and remember all the parts they had read.

- Despite not having time to finish all of this, I've created a prototype using images and sound to enhance the content of some pages so it provides a more engaging experience for the user.

### Things to improve.

- Given the short amount of time available, this is more of a prototype than final product.
- I used a javascript library to help me construct the page flip animation quickly; I also did not have enough time to complete this to my absolute satisfaction, though for the short time frame, I am happy with what's on the screen. 
- I still need to edit some images, find more relevant imagery, find/create soundscapes, test with the text, re-design the timeline at the top, add style so that the images feel more like a collage and refactor the code.
- I would also have liked to be able to focus on the responsive design so it displays properly on mobile.

##### Creators note
	Even though I did lose some important Vitamin-D, it was fun exploring the possibilities for how you could better the experience of an ebook.
